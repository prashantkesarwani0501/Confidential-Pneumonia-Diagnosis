## üî¨ Privacy-Preserving Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays  

### üìå Summary  
This research presents a **comparative analysis of privacy-preserving techniques** for pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images.  
We evaluated **Differential Privacy (Gaussian & Laplace), Federated Learning, Pixelation**, and a **novel hybrid approach** against a baseline CNN model using the **Kaggle Chest X-Ray dataset (5,856 images)**.  

The work highlights the **trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and patient data privacy**, providing practical guidelines for building **privacy-preserving medical AI systems** while addressing compliance requirements such as **HIPAA**.

### üîë Key Findings  
- ‚úÖ **Federated Learning** achieved the highest accuracy (**85.90%**) with decentralized training.  
- ‚úÖ **Gaussian Differential Privacy** offered the best privacy‚Äìutility balance (**83.17% accuracy, 94.10% recall**).  
- ‚úÖ Privacy budget analysis identified an optimal range of **Œµ ‚àà [2.0, 4.0]** for DP.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hybrid approaches (**FL + DP**) introduced excessive complexity, reducing performance significantly.
